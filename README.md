# Business Site

The focus for this project was to create a form and post the information on httpbin, an accordion with the help of javascript and a responsive hero video. 

## The problem

I've structured the page using flexbox. I used media queries to switch between videos of different sizes depending on the screen size. I used javascript for the accordion.
If I had more time I would have done a navbar and played around with more javascript for the accordion.
